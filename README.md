# GMSandbox
----
GMSandbox is a light-weight library for easily adding customized markers on Google map, it has no dependency and very simple APIs.

[Demo]()

###Setup in 30sec

Download code from this repository or Bower, then include it on your web page:
```html
<script type='text/javascript' src='GMSandbox.js'></script>
```
That's it! You don't worry about Google Map API, GMSandbox would lazy load Google Map API and initilize Google map after you instantiated GMSandbox.
